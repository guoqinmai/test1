Step 1:quality control, code:1_zhikong.sh

Step 2:removal of host contamination,code:2_suzhu.sh

Step 3:Compressed files,code:3_yasuo.sh

Step 4:Unzip files,code:4_jieya.sh

Step 5:converted from FASTQ format to FASTA format,code:5_fasta.sh

Step 6:aligned with the genome of pathogenic microorganisms using BLASTN software,code:6_blastn.sh

Step 7: calculating the parameters of the BLASTN results.
These parameters, including the number of matches, average, sum, reads_ratio, and all_sum, are related to the possible pathogenic microorganisms.
Therefore, they were multiplied to obtain the product, and the proportion of each product was calculated. The proportions of the products are arranged in descending order. 
The sample with the highest proportion of the product was considered the suspected pathogen of the sample.code:7_bingyuanjun_tongji.ipynb
